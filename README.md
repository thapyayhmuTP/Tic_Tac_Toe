# Tic_Tac_Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a popular game in which signs such as ❌ and ⭕️ are drawn on a three-by-three grid. 
Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), or Xs and Os (Canadian or Irish English) is a two-player paper-and-pencil game in which players take turns using an X or O to mark the spaces in a three-by-three grid (Wikipedia). 

In this programme, Player X will take position first, followed by Player O. Whoever gets the first three Xs or three Os wins. The system will declare the winner if three consecutive X or O rows, columns, or diagonals are completed, and the player can choose to restart it or abandon it.
